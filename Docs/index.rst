NoiseModelling User Guide
==========================================

This is the **official NoiseModelling User Guide**.

NoiseModelling is a library capable of producing noise maps of cities. This tool is `almost compliant`_ with the CNOSSOS-EU standard method for the noise emission (only road traffic) and noise propagation.
It can be freely used either for research and education, as well as by experts in a professional use.

This plugin is distributed under `GPL 3 license`_ and is developed by the DECIDE team of the Lab-STICC (CNRS) and by the Mixt Research Unit in Environmental Acoustics UMRAE (Ifsttar).
